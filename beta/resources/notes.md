# notes resource type

The entry point for OneNote resources.

All calls to the OneNote service through the Microsoft Graph API use this service root URL:

```
https://graph.microsoft.com/<version>/<location>/notes/ 
```

OneNote support is in preview, so the version is always `beta`. 

Only user and group notebooks on Office 365 are supported. Accessing consumer notebooks or SharePoint site notebooks is currently not supported. 

**User notebooks** To access personal notebooks on OneDrive or OneDrive for Business, use one of the following service root URLs:

```
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/notes/ (current user)
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/<mail>/notes/
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/<objectId>/notes/
```

**Group notebooks** To access notebooks that are owned by a group, use the following service root URL:

```
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/<objectId>/notes/
```

The following permission scopes provide levels of access to OneNote notebooks. Choosing permission scopes depends both on the location of the notebooks you're targeting and your app's functionality. 

**Scopes for personal notebooks in OneDrive for Business that are owned by the current user**

| Scope (enterprise) | Permission in Azure portal | Description |  
|:-------|:------|:------|  
| Notes.Create | Create pages in OneNote notebooks | Can view the titles of your notebooks and sections; create new pages in any location. Cannot view or edit existing pages. |  
| Notes.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp | Application-only OneNote notebook access | Can view the titles of your notebooks and sections; create new pages; view and modify pages created by the app. Cannot view or modify pages created by other apps or in password protected sections. |  
| Notes.Read | View OneNote notebooks | Can view the contents of your notebooks and sections. Cannot create new pages; modify existing pages; access password protected sections. |  
| Notes.ReadWrite | View and modify OneNote notebooks | Can view the titles of your notebooks and sections; view and modify all your pages; create new pages. Cannot access password protected sections. |  

**Scopes for personal notebooks shared by other users and group notebooks that the current user can access**

| Scope (enterprise) | Permission in Azure portal | Description |  
|:-------|:------|:------| 
| Notes.Read.All | View OneNote notebooks in your organization | Can view the contents of notebooks and sections in all notebooks that the signed-in user has access to. Cannot create new pages; modify existing pages; access password protected sections. |  
| Notes.ReadWrite.All | View and modify OneNote notebooks in your organization | Can view the titles of notebooks and sections; view and modify all pages; create new pages in all notebooks that the signed-in user has access to. Cannot access password protected sections. |  

**Note:** Accessing SharePoint site notebooks through the Graph API is currently not supported.

**Scopes for groups**

If you're accessing group notebooks, you'll need a Groups permission scope to get the group ID. Currently, these permissions require administrator rights, but less restrictive access for a narrower scope will be available soon.

| Scope (enterprise) | Permission in Azure portal | Description |  
|:-------|:------|:------|  
| Group.Read.All | Read all groups | Can read all group properties and memberships; read group calendar and conversations on public groups and groups the signed in user is a member of. |  
| Group.ReadWrite.All | Read and write all groups | Can create groups on behalf of the signed-in user and read all group properties and memberships; update group properties and memberships for groups the signed-in user owns; read and write group calendar and conversations on public groups and groups the signed-in user is a member of. |
